title: "Create an AI Chatbot"
description: "Set up a basic conversational AI using Amazon Bedrock."
difficulty: easy
estimated_time: "10-15 minutes"
cost_estimate: "Low (depends on usage)"

steps:
  - ui: "Navigate to Bedrock console"
    why: "Access the Bedrock service."
  - ui: "Choose a foundation model (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet)"
    why: "Claude 3.5 Sonnet is well-suited for conversational tasks due to its reasoning and language understanding capabilities."
  - ui: "Set Temperature to 0.7"
    why: "A temperature of 0.7 provides a good balance between creativity and coherence for chatbot responses."
  - ui: "Set Max Tokens to 500-1000"
    why: "This limits the length of the AI's response, preventing overly verbose answers and controlling costs."
  - ui: "Provide a clear System Prompt"
    why: "The system prompt defines the chatbot's persona, rules, and overall behavior, ensuring consistent interactions."
  - ui: "Test with sample user messages"
    why: "Iteratively test and refine the prompt and parameters to achieve desired chatbot behavior."

security_notes:
  - "Ensure IAM roles have minimal necessary permissions (bedrock:InvokeModel)."
  - "Do not expose sensitive data in prompts or responses."

cost_notes:
  - "Costs are based on input and output tokens. Monitor usage."
  - "Different models have different pricing tiers."

cleanup:
  - "Delete test data or logs if created."
  - "Review and optimize prompts to reduce token usage."
