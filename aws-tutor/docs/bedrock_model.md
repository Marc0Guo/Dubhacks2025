# Foundation Model Selection

## What are Foundation Models?

Foundation models are pre-trained AI models that can be used for various tasks. Bedrock provides access to multiple models from different providers, each with unique strengths and characteristics.

## Available Models

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)

- **Best for**: General purpose, coding, analysis, reasoning
- **Cost**: $3/1M input, $15/1M output tokens
- **Strengths**: Excellent reasoning, code generation, analysis
- **Use cases**: Chatbots, content generation, data analysis

### Claude 3 Haiku (Anthropic)

- **Best for**: Fast, simple tasks
- **Cost**: $0.25/1M input, $1.25/1M output tokens
- **Strengths**: Speed, cost efficiency, simple Q&A
- **Use cases**: Quick responses, simple chatbots, basic tasks

### Titan Text G1-Express (Amazon)

- **Best for**: Basic text generation
- **Cost**: $0.8/1M input, $3.2/1M output tokens
- **Strengths**: Cost, availability, basic tasks
- **Use cases**: Simple text generation, cost-sensitive applications

## How to choose

1. **Consider your use case**: What do you need the AI to do?
2. **Evaluate cost vs. quality**: More expensive models often perform better
3. **Check availability**: Some models require approval
4. **Test performance**: Try different models with your specific tasks
5. **Monitor costs**: Track spending across different models

## Model comparison

| Model                 | Speed  | Quality | Cost | Best For      |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---- | ------------- |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet     | Medium | High    | High | Complex tasks |
| Claude 3 Haiku        | Fast   | Medium  | Low  | Simple tasks  |
| Titan Text G1-Express | Fast   | Low     | Low  | Basic tasks   |

## Pitfalls to avoid

- **Always choosing the most expensive**: Not all tasks need the best model
- **Ignoring cost implications**: Model choice significantly affects costs
- **Not testing alternatives**: Different models may work better for your use case
- **Forgetting about availability**: Some models require approval

## Best practices

1. **Start with Claude 3 Haiku**: Good balance of cost and quality
2. **Upgrade when needed**: Move to Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex tasks
3. **Test thoroughly**: Compare models with your specific use cases
4. **Monitor costs**: Set up billing alerts for each model
5. **Document choices**: Keep track of which model works best for each task
