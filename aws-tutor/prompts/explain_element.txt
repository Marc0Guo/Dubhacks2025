Context:
- Service: {service}
- Element type: {element_type}
- Current value: {current_value}
- Element context: {element_context}

Format your response as JSON with these fields:
- title: Short, clear title for the element
- what: What this element does (2-3 sentences)
- why: Why this element matters and how it affects the AI (2-3 sentences)

Example response:
{
  "title": "Temperature Parameter",
  "what": "Controls randomness and creativity in AI responses. Lower values (0.1-0.3) produce more focused, deterministic responses. Higher values (0.7-1.0) generate more creative and varied outputs.",
  "why": "Temperature affects both response quality and consistency. For chatbots, 0.7 is usually optimal - creative but not random. For factual tasks, use 0.1-0.3 for more reliable answers.",
  "pitfalls": "Too low (0.1): Responses become repetitive and boring. Too high (0.9+): Responses may become incoherent or off-topic. Default 0.5 works for most use cases."
}
